The following are programs that demonstrate Moby's features.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


rolling-out-of-time.ss: a game that uses the tilt sensor to play a
ball-rolling game.


minding-the-store.ss: an application that uses the GPS location
feature and Google Maps web-service to alert the user when we're close
to an interesting grocery store.


homeward-bound.ss: another GPS application that also uses SMS to
notify another of the place where a user is located.


bell-ringing.ss: uses a shake handler to play a bell sound whenever the
phone is jerked.  The user interface allows switching to different
notes.


lullaby.ss: plays songs from the user's playlist; as time
progresses, the volume of the music drops unless the phone is shaked.
