Details on Beginner Scheme primitives:


Primitives that need implementation:

(format
 image=?
 image-rotate)

You can look at the code in support/j2me/src/org/plt/WorldKernel.java
and support/common/src/org/plt/Kernel.java for implementations of the
primitives we support so far.  Any primitive you write also needs to
be registered in moby/src/toplevel.ss.
