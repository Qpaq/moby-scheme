* Image transparency isn't being done during image lifting.  This
  might be a problem in DrScheme itself, as pure white is being
  treated as the transparent color, which is the wrong approach: we
  should be using alpha transparency throughout.

* The test case org.plt.TestKernel.testBigExp is failing because
  our current approach always converts to floating point.

* BigInteger literals aren't being handled in beginner-to-javascript

* Functions that are recursive can trigger an effective stack
  overflow, manifested as an exception in android.view.ViewRoot.draw.
  Run the sketch test program for some period of time, and the error
  should mainfest.

* The unit tests in TestKernel concerning the complex numbers aren't
  exercising that functionality correctly.

* placeImage breaks if the scene passed in is an Image, and not a
  Scene.

* apks hosted on a web server may not be hosted properly.  This may be
  a consequence of
  http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1085, but I'm not
  sure.

* open-image-url breaks badly if the image url isn't good.

* The reader in read.ss doesn't tell the location in the exception object
  it throws.

* The identifiers in read.js aren't in the plt package.
