* Image transparency isn't being done during image lifting.  This
  might be a problem in DrScheme itself, as pure white is being
  treated as the transparent color, which is the wrong approach: we
  should be using alpha transparency throughout.

* The test case org.plt.TestKernel.testBigExp is failing because
  our current approach always converts to floating point.

* BigInteger literals aren't being handled in beginner-to-java.

* Name mangling doesn't handle java keywords.  A defined variable
  named "long", for example, breaks the compiler.

* If a program is given to the compiler that doesn't have a big-bang
  call, we should fail immediately.

* Functions that are recursive can trigger an effective stack
  overflow, manifested as an exception in android.view.ViewRoot.draw.
  Run the sketch test program for some period of time, and the error
  should mainfest.

* The performance of the world primitives is poor on the Android
  platform.
