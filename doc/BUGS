* Location services doesn't automatically turn on.  See http://osdir.com/ml/AndroidDevelopers/2009-01/msg01186.html.

* Image transparency isn't being done during image lifting.  This
  might be a problem in DrScheme itself, as pure white is being
  treated as the transparent color, which is the wrong approach: we
  should be using alpha transparency throughout.

* The test case org.plt.TestKernel.testBigExp is failing because
  our current approach always converts to floating point.

* Vararity functions aren't being handled uniformly.

* Complex literals aren't being handles in beginner-to-java.ss.

* BigInteger literals aren't being handled in beginner-to-java.

* require isn't properly handled in beginner-to-java.

* Name mangling doesn't handle java keywords.  A defined variable
  named "long", for example, breaks the compiler.
