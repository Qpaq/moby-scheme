Here are the TODOs:


If you wish to take any of these on, please contact us

first to consult on the design of solutions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Major:

* Implement all of the Beginner Scheme primitives in the runtime.
  The list of primitives comes at the end of this file.

* Expose Android-specific functionality.  Definitely talk to us before
  tackling this one: we want to make sure the design matches the
  functional flavor of the world primitives.

* Fix the bugs listed in BUGS.

* Port the gui-world teachpack to Moby.

* Port universe.ss to Moby.

* Work on the network compiler.

   - Add error trapping.

   - Design security features.

   - Set up server.

   - Set up watchdog.



Minor:


* The bridge classes we've adopted for the J2ME-Android bridge are not
  reproducing correct behavior.  We need someone to investigate and
  fix the differences described in j2me-android-gui-differences.txt.

* Add more unit test cases for the functions in org.plt.Kernel.  There
  are very few tests at this point.  Any new primitives should have
  tests written for them.  These tests should be in
  src/test/java-src/org/plt/TestKernel.java, exercising code that's in
  support/common/src/org/plt/Kernel.java.

* Improve the design of the numeric support.  For expediency, the
  kernel code reproduced the behavior of the numeric tower with a
  bunch of hardcoded if statements.  We want to look existing
  implementations of the numeric tower from other Java Scheme systems
  like SISC and adopt one of them.

* Remove unnecessary classes like MicroFloat from Android platform
  compilation.  Android guarantees a floating-point unit; our current
  implementation uses the MicroFloat fixed-point library even though
  we don't need it.

Details on Beginner Scheme primitives:


Primitives that need implementation:

You can look at the code in support/src/org/plt/Kernel.java for
implementations of the primitives we support so far.  Any primitive
you write also needs to be registered in the
IMPLEMENTED-JAVA-KERNEL-SYMBOLS in src/beginner-to-java.ss.
