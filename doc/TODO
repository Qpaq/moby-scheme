Implementation of more of the Beginner Scheme primitives in the runtime.

Add gui-world primitives to the runtime.

Add android platform as target.

    * Extend compile-world with a function that produces programs for
      android.

    * Remove unnecessary classes like Microfloat.

    * Expose android-specific functionality.

Add web service to access the compiler from network clients.

    * Add DrScheme tool to hook into the web service.

Handle resolution independence by automatically scaling images to the
size of the device.

For the web service: I just want something network accessible.  Basically, I want to be able to call the generate-j2me-application function from a network client.

Actually, the signature's going to be slightly different: it should be:

;; make-fresh-j2me-application: string bytes -> bytes
;; Given the name of the application and the bytes 
;; of the beginner-level program, produce the bytes
;; of the jar.

and I'd like this to be network accessible.  A very thin xmlrpc hook would be a simple way to do this.  Then we could add a DrScheme tool to invoke the compiler from a menu option so that we integrate really well into the existing environment as an item just like "Create Executable."

You can look at the code in support/plt/Kernel.java for
implementations of the primitives we support so far.  Any primitive
you write also needs to be registered in the
IMPLEMENTED-JAVA-KERNEL-SYMBOLS in beginner-to-java.ss.
