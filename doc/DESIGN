[rough notes: cleanup]

big bang width/height arguments are superfluous.

The same redundancy in the arguments to big-bang applies both to the
gui-world and the cellphone-world.

In the cellphone situation, we do need to get the dimensions of the
scenes in order to determine portrait-vs-landscape layout at runtime.
If we assume that the scenes produced by the world->scene function all
are the same size, we can take the scene produced by (world->scene
world0) to determine the appropriate layout.

Deviations from Beginner Level scheme.


Currently, rationals are implemented as fixnums.  We need to switch
over to bignums eventually to avoid problems.
