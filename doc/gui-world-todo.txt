The GUI subclasses:

  canvas
  slider

are still in need of implementation.


Implement these in the GuiRenderer class:

    moby/support/j2me/src/org/plt/guiworld/GuiRenderer



The widgets are in:

    moby/support/common/src/org/plt/guiworld/


As you add implementations for the widgets, adjust the GuiWorldTest
program in

    moby/sandbox/guiworld

and test the widgets out.



Integrate the other event hooks (on-location, on-tilt, on-acceleration, on-key, on-tick) into gui-world.
