Catalog of differences we see in the J2ME-Android bridge.


* The font used in the text image constructor produces larger text in
  Android than in J2ME.  hello-world is an example that shows the
  problem.  See images/hello.png, which shows a screenshot of both.


* In Cowabunga, the frame rate on Android seems to be running faster
  than in J2ME.  The controls are also slightly less responsive:
  sometimes pressing left doesn't register quickly enough.  This might
  be a side effect of the fast frame rate.


* Falling cow: the frame rate of the cow falling in android seems
  choppier than that of j2me.


* Firefighter: the animation of Firefighter slows down tremendously
  when there are a lot of images in Android.  Pressing down a lot
  makes the animation chunk up, with very bad latency on controls.
  This isn't a problem in J2ME.

* Flightlander: the animation is much too fast in Android.
  Thread.sleep isn't performing the same?
