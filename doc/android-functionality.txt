We want Scheme API's for the following Android and J2ME-specific
functionality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Location Services

get-latitude: -> number
get-longitude: -> number

Optionally, if the mobile device supports it:

get-attitude: -> number
get-bearing: -> number
get-speed: -> number

------

* Accelerometer Sercies

???





* HTTP GET for RESTful services.

get-response: url -> input-port




* SMS Message listening

on-sms-message: (world sms-message -> world) -> void


* Phone calling.
  dial: phone-number -> void


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Less important, but things to look at:


* File persistance

  open-file-input: String -> input-port
  open-file-output: String -> output-port


  Android supports SQLite:

  create-database: string number -> db
  exec-sql: db string -> void
  raw-query: db string (listof string) -> cursor
  ... 

  with all the SQL stuff.



  J2ME has RecordStore, which is a byte-oriented interface to a persistent store:
      
  open-record-store: string boolean -> rs
  add-record: rs number bytes -> void
  get-record: rs number -> bytes
  set-record: rs number bytes -> void


  We want an API that transparently hides the complexity of these
  approaches.  Ideally, we should have something that can deal
  with structs.


     
* Google Maps gui widget.  We'd expose this as an extension of
  gui-world; it behaves as a canvas with a few more hooks.  Appears
  only available for Android.



* Audio and video

  (Not stable in Android yet.)


  In J2ME, the MMAPI provides:

  create-player: string -> player
  start: player -> void
