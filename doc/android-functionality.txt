The Android and J2ME specific functionality includes, roughly:

    * File persistance

      open-file-input: String -> input-port
      open-file-output: String -> output-port

    * Location Services

      get-latitude: -> number
      get-longitude: -> number

      Optionally, if the mobile device supports it:

      get-attitude: -> (U number #f)
      get-bearing: -> (U number #f)
      get-speed: -> (U number #f)
     
    * Google Maps gui widget.  We'd expose this as an extension of gui-world.

    * HTTP GET for REST services

      get-response: url -> input-port

    * Audio and video

      (Not stable in Android yet.)

    * Phone calling.

      dial: phone-number -> void
