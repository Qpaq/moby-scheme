We want Scheme API's for the following Android functionality.


* Native window size: we should be able to provide the native window
  size.

get-width, get-height




* SMS Message listening for the world.

on-sms-message: (world sms-message -> world) -> void


* Phone calling.

  dial: phone-number world -> world

Should dial the phone, and when the user finally finishes the call,
returns the world back to the caller.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Less important, but things to look at:


* Camera access.



* File persistance

  open-file-input: String -> input-port
  open-file-output: String -> output-port


  Android supports SQLite:

  create-database: string number -> db
  exec-sql: db string -> void
  raw-query: db string (listof string) -> cursor
  ... 

  with all the SQL stuff, as well as standard file access.


  We want an API that transparently hides the complexity of file
  storage.  Ideally, we should have something that can deal with
  structs.


     
* Google Maps gui widget.  We'd expose this as an extension of
  gui-world; it behaves as a canvas with a few more hooks.  Appears
  only available for Android.



* Audio and video

    http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/index.html

We want to support audio capture and playback.

  In J2ME, the MMAPI provides:

  create-player: string -> player
  start: player -> void
