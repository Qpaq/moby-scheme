What is Moby?

Moby is a project from the PLT Scheme team.  The Moby compiler
consumes Intermediate Student Language (ISL) programs that use World
primitives, and produces applications for mobile platforms.  The
current prototype supports the Android platform and desktop browsers.
Our long-term goal is to make Scheme the premiere reactive scripting
language for mobile phones.

Shriram Krishnamurthi presented the ideas behind Moby at ILC 2009;
his talk "The Moby Scheme Compiler for Smartphones" can be found here:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does it work?

The compiler takes a ISL program and translates it to Javascript code.
We've reimplemented the ISL primitives in a Javascript runtime library
that's included with the compiled application.  (See
doc/moby-developer-api.txt for more details.)

To support Android, we use a bridge library called Phonegap, which
provides access to the native facilities of several cell phones.  In
this way, we should be able to support multiple platforms with a lot
of code reuse.  We handle the other libraries (tilt, location, sms,
music), though with support only for the Android platforms for now.

Dependencies

Moby is mostly written in PLT Scheme, and the project sources are
hosted by github.com.  To develop with Moby, you will need the
following:

  PLT Scheme >=4.1.3 (http://plt-scheme.org/)
  git (http://git-scm.com)



If you wish to generate programs for the Android+Phonegap backend,
you'll also need:

  Java >=1.6 (http://java.sun.com/)
  Apache Ant >=1.7.1 (http://ant.apache.org/)
  Google Android SDK >= 1.5r3 (http://developer.android.com/)


----------------------------------------------------------------------


To install Moby:

    1.  Grab the Moby source, currently hosted on github at:

        http://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme/tree/devel

    For example:

        $ git clone git://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme.git moby

    2.  Switch to the development branch.

        $ git checkout devel


    3.  Pull the other dependency packages.  Moby depends on two
    additional libraries that we are developing: (1) jsworld (2)
    phonegap.  The following command will bring both of those
    dependencies into the source tree.

        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update


    4.  If you're going to do Android development, edit
        moby/src/config.ss.  The system hardcodes paths to Apache Ant
        and Android SDK embedded as parameters within src/config.ss.
        You should change those paths to the ones on your system.

Running Moby from the command line


At this point, you can run the Moby command line utility
(moby/src/moby.ss) on a BSL program.  Moby supports two backends, both
which rely on Javascript:

    * js: compiles to web application 

    * js+android-phonegap: compiles to Android application; can also
      use features of the mobile platform.


By default, the command line utility with compile with the js backend.

Let's run moby on the falling-ball.ss example in
moby/examples/falling-ball.ss.  We can first generate a web program.

    $ cd moby/examples
    $ mred ../src/moby.ss falling-ball.ss
    $ cd FallingBall/
    $ ls
    index.html  main.js  runtime  test

If you open up index.html from your web browser, you should see red
ball falling down the screen.


Furthermore, we may want to generate an Android application.

    $ cd moby/examples
    $ mred ../src/moby.ss -t js+android-phonegap falling-ball.ss
    $ cd FallingBall
    $ ls
    AndroidManifest.xml  build.properties    gen               res
    assets               build.xml           libs              src
    bin                  default.properties  local.properties  tests

    $ ls bin
    classes  classes.dex  DroidGap.ap_  DroidGap-debug.apk

DroidGap-debug.apk is the compiled Android binary.  The Ant build.xml
build-script in the FallingBall directory can install, uninstall, and
reinstall the application if the Android emulator is online.

    $ ant install
Buildfile: build.xml

[some output cut]

install:
     [echo] Installing bin/DroidGap-debug.apk onto default emulator...
     [exec] 1594 KB/s (120997 bytes in 0.074s)

     [exec] Success
03:39 I/ddms: Closing [Client pid: 1641]

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 6 seconds


After this, you can look at the Android emulator, which should now
have the FallingBall application installed.
