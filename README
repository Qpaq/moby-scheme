What is Moby?

Moby is a project from the PLT Scheme team.  The Moby compiler
consumes Intermediate Student Language (ISL) programs that use World
primitives, and produces applications for mobile platforms.  The
current prototype supports the Android platform.  Our long-term goal
is to make Scheme the premiere reactive scripting language for mobile
phones.

Shriram Krishnamurthi presented the ideas behind Moby at ILC 2009;
his talk "The Moby Scheme Compiler for Smartphones" can be found here:

    http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/Moby-Bootstrap/


----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does it work?

The compiler takes a ISL program and translates it to Javascript code.
We've reimplemented the ISL primitives in a Javascript runtime library
that's included with the compiled application.

To support Android, we use a bridge library called Phonegap, which
provides access to the native facilities of several cell phones.  In
this way, we should be able to support multiple platforms with a lot
of code reuse.  We handle the other libraries (tilt, location, sms,
music), though with support only for the Android platforms for now.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies

You need the following:

  Java >=1.6 (http://java.sun.com/)
  Apache Ant >=1.7.1 (http://ant.apache.org/)
  PLT Scheme >=4.1.3 (http://plt-scheme.org/)
  Google Android SDK >= 1.5r3 (http://developer.android.com/)


----------------------------------------------------------------------


To install Moby:

    1.  Grab the Moby source, currently hosted on github at:

        http://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme/tree/master

    For example:

        $ git clone git://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme.git moby

    2.  Switch to the development branch.

        $ git checkout devel


    3.  Pull other dependency packages.  Moby depends on two
    additional libraries that we are developing: (1) jsworld (2)
    phonegap.  The following command will bring both of those
    dependencies into the source tree.

        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update


    3.  Edit moby/src/config.ss.  The system hardcodes
        paths to Apache Ant and Android SDK embedded as parameters
        within src/config.ss.  You should change those paths to the
        ones on your system.

    3.  Add a symbolic link from moby to the collects directory of
    your PLT Scheme installation.

        For example, if moby is under the home directory, and PLT Scheme
        under the ~/local/plt directory, then the command:

            $ ln -s ~/moby ~/local/plt/collects/moby

        will set up the necessary symbolic link.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Running Moby from the command line


At this point, you can run the Moby command line utility
(moby/src/moby.ss) on a BSL program.  Moby supports two backends, both
which rely on Javascript:

    * js: compiles to web application 

    * js+android-phonegap: compiles to Android application; can also
      use features of the mobile platform.


Let's run moby on the falling-ball.ss example in
moby/examples/falling-ball.ss:

    $ cd moby/examples
    $ mred ../src/moby.ss falling-ball.ss
    $ cd FallingBall
    $ ls
    index.html   main.js  runtime  test


FallingBall-debug.apk is the compiled Android binary.  The Ant
build.xml build-script in the FallingBall directory can install,
uninstall, and reinstall the application if the Android emulator
is online.

    $ ant install
Buildfile: build.xml

dirs:
     [echo] Creating output directories if needed...

resource-src:
     [echo] Generating R.java / Manifest.java from the resources...

     [echo] Compiling aidl files into Java classes...

    [javac] Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

     [echo] Converting compiled files and external libraries into bin/classes.dex...

package-res:

     [echo] Packaging resources...

     [echo] Packaging bin/FallingBall-debug.apk, and signing it with a debug key...
     [exec] Using keystore: /home/dyoo/.android/debug.keystore

     [echo] Installing bin/FallingBall-debug.apk onto default emulator...
     [exec] 726 KB/s (157611 bytes in 0.211s)
     [exec] 	pkg: /data/local/tmp/FallingBall-debug.apk
     [exec] Success

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 19 seconds


After this, you can look at the Android emulator, which should now
have the FallingBall application installed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Regression test suite


We've got the beginnings of a regression test suite in
moby/src/test-compile-world.ss.  The test suite compiles several
applications in moby/src/test/; the suite saves compiled executables
in src/bin for manual inspection.

To run the regression test suite, open the
moby/src/test-compile-world.ss module in DrScheme.  You can then run
the run-all-tests function.  If everything runs successfully, every
sub-subdirectory in moby/src/bin will contain a compiled application.
Each application will have an ant file that you can use to install the
application into the Android emulator.

For Android, first start the emulator, then use

    ant install

or

    ant reinstall

For example:

## Running in DrScheme:

    Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.3 [3m].
    Language: Module.
    > (run-all-tests)


## This should take some time.  Afterwards, at your shell, cd into
   moby/src.

~/moby/src$


## Let's try out the falling-ball example.  The source for the 
## falling ball example is in test/falling-ball.ss.


~/moby/src$ cd bin
~/moby/src/bin$ ls
android
## Let's test the Android binary.  If you haven't started up the
## emulator, do so now.

~/moby/src/bin$ cd android/falling-ball
~/moby/src/bin/android/falling-ball$ ant install

## The application should deploy into the emulator.  Try running the
   program, and you should see a red ball descend.

Unit tests

Minimal unit tests for the Java runtime live in moby/src/test.  To run
the unit tests, run the build.xml in src/test with ant.  Here's an
example run of the test suite:
