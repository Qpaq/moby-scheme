What is Moby?

Moby is a project from the PLT Scheme team.  The Moby compiler
consumes Advanced Student Language (ASL) programs that use World[1]
primitives, and produces applications for mobile platforms.  The
current prototype supports desktop browsers and smartphones.  Our
long-term goal is to make Scheme the premiere reactive scripting
language for mobile phones.

Shriram Krishnamurthi presented the ideas behind Moby at ILC 2009 in
his talk "The Moby Scheme Compiler for Smartphones"[2].

The documentation for Moby can be found on PLaneT:
