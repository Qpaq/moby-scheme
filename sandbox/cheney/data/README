Measurements made on a Macbook Pro 2.33 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB 667
MHz DDR2 SDRAM, using cheney-test-3.html, under Mac OS 10.5.6.

Qualitative observations: With the timeout-based approaches, CPU usage
is almost zero; it appears that a call to setTimeout(..., 0) does not
immediately execute at high priority.  The browser appears to freeze
under the exception handling approach, whereas under setTimeout, the
browser regains control immediately.

Under Safari 3, stack height is limited to a ceiling around 90-100;
going beyond that will kill whatever computation is being done without
an error message.
